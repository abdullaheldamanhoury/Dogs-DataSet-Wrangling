<li>After the gathering, assessing, and cleaning processes, the datasets were analysed. This data analysis aimed to produce three insights and more than one visualization.</li>
  
<ol>
<li>Calculate the mean and median for the predictions 'prediction_1_confidence', 'prediction_2_confidence' and 'prediction_3_confidence'. </li>
<li>Describe the data records of 'prediction_1_confidence', 'prediction_2_confidence' and 'prediction_3_confidence' distributed. </li>
<li>Extract the names of the dogs with the highest prediction rates of 'prediction_1_confidence','prediction_2_confidence' and 'prediction_3_confidence' with the doge image, retweet count, favorite count, text and breed of dogs. </li>
</ol>
</ul>
